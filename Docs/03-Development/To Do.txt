COMPLETED:

      (X) Remove Argentina Specific Copy and flag (unless it pertains to regional section layouts). We want Bit Agora to be region agnostic and appeal to a broad set of users.

      (X) Remove "Overview section" in Admin Panel? Seems redundant. Move Recent activity to new page under Business Section (Place under Products).

      (X) Make Parent Catgory font/logos slightly larger and/or more bold than their child pages (Business, Team, Payment, Settings) for clearer user parsing.

      (X) PIN Login Not working?

      (X) Add Business Name to Header

      (X) Low stock indicator

      (X) 86'd Indicator 

      (x) QR CODE Payments (multiple)


ONBOARDING:

-Navigation: Removed onboarding progress bars, added admin headers (I like the progress bar, bring it back?)

POS:

   

CHECKOUT/REGISTER:


SECURITY:

      () Time lock APP Screen (PIN Pad Re-Login)
         We need to create a settting in ADMIN/SETTINGS that allows the admin to set the time it takes for the Application to Lock. Take note that the same application will be used by multiple people in a matter of seconds or minutes (like a busy restaurant).


SETTINGS:

   APPLICATION:

   LOGIN SCREEN:

      () Swap Admin and POS positions
      () LOGOUT BUTTON SHOULD 

   PAYMENTS:

      () QR Code files not showing "uploaded" even though they have been
      () Move Card Payments Section to bottom 


   WALLETS:

      () Wallet Monitoring for amounts (from Blockchain & Lightning)
      () "Valut" Wallet that is reccomended Cold Storage. This is where the merchant
         enters their Cold Wallet "Vault" Address for Lightning and Hot Wallet 
         transfer for security.
      () Bitcoin & Lightning Wallet monitoring for minimum threshold before notifying
         user that they should transfer funds to Vault. User sets amounts in Admin/Wallet 
         settings.
      () UTXO monitoring. Monitor UTX0's so that merchant can avoid having small UTXO sets
         in their Vault. 
   
   USERS:

      () Change ADMIN and Manager Pin to 6-digits (employee pins can remain      4-digits
      (x) Role Based Permissions. Create confirmation pop-up on Admin and Manager level changes (Pin Confirmation)
      () Wallet Address
      ()

   PRODUCTS:

      () Product Upload from legacy POS system (PHASE 3)
      () Low Inventory Count Setting (Global Default and Custom for each product)
      () Product Discounts (PHASE 3)
