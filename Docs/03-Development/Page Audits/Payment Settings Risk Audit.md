**Impact Assessment**:
- ‚úÖ **UI/UX**: None - API changes are transparent to UI
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Functionality**: High - API failures break core functionality
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Business**: High - Could prevent payment configuration

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Maintain exact API contracts** during service layer creation
2. **Preserve error handling behavior** initially
3. **Test all API endpoints** after service layer implementation

- State updates triggering cascading re-renders
- Missing memoization causing performance issues

**Impact Assessment**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **UI/UX**: Medium - could cause lag or stuttering
- ‚úÖ **Functionality**: None - performance issue only
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Business**: Low - poor UX but not functionality loss

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Monitor render performance** during decomposition
2. **Add React.memo** to expensive components
3. **Use useCallback** for event handlers
4. **Implement proper dependency arrays**

**Testing Requirements**:
- [ ] Performance profiling before/after changes

- Optional vs required field confusion
- Generic type constraints issues

**Impact Assessment**:
- ‚úÖ **UI/UX**: None - compile-time issue
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Functionality**: Medium - runtime errors possible
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Business**: Low - caught during development

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Strict TypeScript compilation** throughout process
2. **Comprehensive type testing** for all interfaces

- ‚úÖ **Functionality**: None - styling doesn't affect functionality
- ‚úÖ **Business**: None - cosmetic issues only

**Mitigation Strategy**:
1. **Preserve exact CSS classes** during component splitting
2. **Test responsive design** after changes
3. **Maintain component hierarchy** for styling inheritance
4. **Use CSS-in-JS** if needed for component isolation

---

### **7. Form Validation Logic**
