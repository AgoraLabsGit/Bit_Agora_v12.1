# Payment Provider Implementation Roadmap
## Argentina-First MVP Strategy

**🚨 CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: All development must happen in the Payment Testing Lab (`/payment-testing`) to ensure ZERO disruption to current production Strike Lightning payments.**

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

This roadmap outlines the phased implementation of a dynamic payment provider system, starting with Mercado Pago Argentina as the MVP. The strategy emphasizes:

- **Safety First**: All development isolated in testing environment
- **Argentina Focus**: Single country implementation to validate architecture
- **Zero Production Risk**: Current POS system remains untouched
- **Gradual Rollout**: Measured expansion after Argentina success

## 🛡️ Safety Measures Throughout Implementation

### 1. **Isolated Development Environment**
```bash
# All development happens in:
/payment-testing/
├── lib/providers/           # Provider implementations
├── services/               # API services
├── components/             # UI components
├── utils/                  # Utility functions
└── types/                  # TypeScript definitions
```

### 2. **Feature Flag System**
```typescript
// Environment-based feature flags
const PAYMENT_FEATURES = {
  MERCADO_PAGO_AR: process.env.ENABLE_MERCADO_PAGO_AR === 'true',
  MERCADO_PAGO_BR: process.env.ENABLE_MERCADO_PAGO_BR === 'true',
  PROVIDER_SYSTEM: process.env.ENABLE_PROVIDER_SYSTEM === 'true',
  TESTING_MODE: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'
}
```

### 3. **Production Isolation**
- **Current POS**: Remains unchanged throughout development
- **Strike Lightning**: Continues working as primary payment method
- **Testing Lab**: Only place where new providers are accessible
- **No Migration**: Zero impact on existing merchant configurations

### 4. **Rollback Strategy**
```typescript
// Instant rollback capability
const fallbackToStrike = () => {
  // Disable all new providers
  setFeatureFlag('PROVIDER_SYSTEM', false);
  // Redirect to current Strike Lightning flow
  redirectToLegacyPayment();
}
```
