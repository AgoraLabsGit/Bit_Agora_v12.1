Perfect! Now I have comprehensive information about Strike API and vetted JavaScript libraries. Let me create a detailed Strike integration plan with well-tested libraries.## ðŸš€ **Excellent! Here's your complete Strike integration plan with bulletproof libraries:**

## ðŸ“¦ **Production-Ready Library Stack**

### **âœ… HTTP Client: Axios (152K+ projects use it)**
- Battle-tested with automatic JSON parsing
- Built-in error handling and interceptors  
- Request/response transformation
- Works in browser + Node.js

### **âœ… Lightning Validation: bolt11 (Official bitcoinjs)**
- BOLT-11 spec compliant (Lightning Network standard)
- Most trusted library for Lightning invoices
- Used by 21+ production projects

### **âœ… Validation: Zod (Already in BitAgora)**
- Runtime validation for API responses
- TypeScript-first with excellent error messages

## ðŸŽ¯ **Key Benefits of This Approach**

### **âœ… Merchant-Focused**
- Each merchant gets their own Strike account
- Lightning payments go directly to merchant
- Auto-settlement to merchant's BTC wallet
- No complex Lightning infrastructure needed

### **âœ… Production-Ready**
- Professional Strike API designed for businesses
- Comprehensive error handling and retries
- Security best practices built-in
- Easy scaling to 1000+ merchants

### **âœ… Developer-Friendly**
- Well-documented libraries with TypeScript support
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy testing and debugging
- Graceful fallbacks when APIs unavailable

## ðŸ§ª **Testing Strategy**

The plan includes a complete testing framework:
1. **API integration tests** with real Strike sandbox
2. **Lightning wallet compatibility** testing  
3. **Error scenario handling** validation
4. **Performance benchmarking** under load

## âš¡ **Implementation Timeline: 4 Weeks**

- **Week 1**: Core Strike API integration
- **Week 2**: Merchant management system  
- **Week 3**: Testing and refinement
- **Week 4**: Production deployment

## ðŸ”‘ **Critical Success Factors**

1. **Apply for Strike Business API** access immediately
2. **Start with sandbox testing** using small amounts
3. **Test with real Lightning wallets** early and often
4. **Focus on merchant experience** - they should just see payments work

**This approach transforms your Lightning payment error into a competitive advantage - merchants get professional Lightning receiving capability without any technical complexity!**

Ready to start with the Strike API application, or would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of the implementation?
